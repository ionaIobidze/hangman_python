## Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess the word letter by letter. 
The player has a limited number of lives, and for each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman gets drawn. If the player guesses all the letters before running out of lives, they win; otherwise, they lose.

### How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` file.
2. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, you'll lose a life.
